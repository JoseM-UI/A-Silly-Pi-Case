# A-Silly-Pi-Case-
A Raspberry Pi case, nothing too special - works with or without PoE hat (Check Versions)

The "Silly .STL File" has the .step too FOR PoE

"Plain" Case has .STL and .step for not PoE hat

- Able to access all ports including pins and mirco-sd card easily 
- A small presentable case :3
- Has ventilation
  
I know that the ventilation isnt optimal but it looks cool
The clips on the "lid" are fragile and could snap - sooo be careful when removing "lid"

Going to Realease different versions of the same case, but both will have an .STL or .step
